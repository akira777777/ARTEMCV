# Palette's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - [Initial Entry]
**Learning:** Initialized Palette's journal.
**Action:** Will document critical UX/a11y learnings here.

## 2025-01-31 - [Keyboard visibility for hover-only actions]
**Learning:** UI elements that only reveal themselves on hover (like the Barbershop project link in BentoGrid) are invisible to keyboard users even when focused.
**Action:** Use `group-focus-within:opacity-100` and `focus:opacity-100` to ensure keyboard accessibility for hidden interactive elements.
